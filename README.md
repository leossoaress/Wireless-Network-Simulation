# Wireless Network Simulation

## Introduction

Wireless Network is a compute network that uses wireless data connections between networks nodes, in this project, nodes can be known as host. Wireless network uses radio frequencies to communicates between hosts and are based in TCP/IP conceptual model, which there're five layers of functions: physical, link, Internet, transport and application. In this code, we'll simulate only the three lower layers, physical, link and Internet.
